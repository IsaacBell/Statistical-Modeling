Finding the correct pairs to trade for a pair trading algorithm involves using statistical analysis to identify pairs of financial instruments that are related and have historically exhibited a high degree of correlation. This can be done using a variety of methods, including the following:

Identify pairs of financial instruments that are related, such as two stocks in the same industry or two currencies that are commonly traded together.

Use statistical techniques such as regression analysis or cointegration analysis to calculate the historical correlation between the pairs of instruments.

Select pairs with a high degree of historical correlation, typically above 0.7 or 0.8, as these are likely to exhibit similar price movements in the future.

Monitor the selected pairs over time to ensure that their correlation remains strong and that they continue to be suitable for pair trading.

Overall, the process of finding the correct pairs to trade for a pair trading algorithm involves using statistical analysis to identify pairs of related instruments that have historically exhibited a high degree of correlation. By selecting pairs with a strong historical correlation, traders can increase their chances of success with a pair trading algorithm.
